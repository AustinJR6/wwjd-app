## 📖 Overview

**OneVine** is a mobile app built to guide users through daily moral and spiritual reflection based on their faith. Originally launched as **WWJD**, the app has grown to support **multi-religious guidance**, **token-based engagement**, **journaling**, and **faith-based leaderboards**.

This project uses **React Native (via Expo)** and is powered by **Firebase** for authentication, Firestore storage, and Stripe integration for premium features.
